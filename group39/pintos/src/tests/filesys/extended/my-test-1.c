Test your buffer cacheâ€™s effectiveness by measuring its cache hit rate.
First, reset the buffer cache. Open a file and read it sequentially,
to determine the cache hit rate for a cold cache. Then, close it, re-open it,
and read it sequentially again, to make sure that the cache hit rate improves.
